Level Editor How to:
====================

For VS 2013
-----------
- open solution file and run code

For Linux
---------
- save *.cpp, *.h, and all resource files to their respective folders and make

The level editor is mostly functional all that's missing is:
- deleting placed tiles
- loading level file instead of sprite list
- fine tuning selection (no set frame rate so tiles are skipped)
 
Use
---

- Left mouse click places tiles
- Arrow keys cycle through tiles imported from spritesheet
- space bar saves level file
